# mim_solvers
Implementation of efficient numerical optimal control solvers.
In particular, the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) solver described in [this paper](https://laas.hal.science/hal-04330251) solves nonlinear constrained OCPs efficiently by leveraging sparsity.

All the solvers are implemented based on the API of [Crocoddyl](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl/tree/devel) (v2).
In other words, our solvers take as input a `crocoddyl.ShootingProblem`.

Examples on how to use the solvers can be found in the `examples` directory.

# Dependencies
- [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) (rigid-body dynamics computations)
- [Crocoddyl](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl) (optimal control library)
- [ProxSuite](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite) (quadratic programming) (optional)

# Installation

  ## Using conda

`conda install mim-solvers --channel conda-forge`


  ## Using CMake
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/machines-in-motion/mim_solvers.git`

`cd mim_solvers && mkdir build && cd build`

`cmake .. [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release] [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=...]`

`make [-j6] && make install`

You can also run unittests using `ctest` and benchmarks using `./benchmarks/ur5` or `./benchmarks/solo12` from the build directory.
